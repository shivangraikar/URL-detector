# Malicious URL Detector

## Overview
This Malicious URL Detector is a part of my Applied Machine Learning coursework, focusing on cybersecurity and phishing detection. The project utilizes a machine learning model to predict whether a given URL is benign or malicious.

## Introduction
The Malicious URL Detector is designed to assist users in determining the nature of a URL and categorizing it as either benign or malicious. It provides a simple web interface where users can input a URL, and the model returns a binary classification score (0 or 1). A score of '0' indicates a benign URL, while '1' suggests that the URL is malicious.

## Getting Started
To use the Malicious URL Detector, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shivangraikar/URL-detector.git
   cd URL-detector

2. Run the app:
  ```
  streamlit run app.py
  ```
  This should get your app running on your localhost port

## Usage
* Access the web interface and read the instructions.
* Check the "I agree" box to proceed.
* Enter a URL in the text field.
* Click the prediction button to obtain a binary classification score (0 or 1).
* Interpret the result: '0' for benign URLs, '1' for malicious URLs.
